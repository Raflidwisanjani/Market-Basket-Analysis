# MARKET BASKET ANALYSIS

there are 2 stages in this project, data preparation and data analysis. to see the queries, you can check out the Market-Basket-Analysis.sql file.

## 1.DATA PREPARATION
### 1.1 Reshaping Data
Uncleaned version of dataset is too complex for eyes to see, each row means every single transactions with all purchased items in columns as it shown below:

|Item(s)|Item 1          |Item 2             |Item 3        |Item 4                  |Item 5            |Item 6|Item 7|Item 8|Item 9|Item 10|Item 11|Item 12|Item 13|Item 14|Item 15|Item 16|Item 17|Item 18|Item 19|Item 20|Item 21|Item 22|Item 23|Item 24|Item 25|Item 26|Item 27|Item 28|Item 29|Item 30|Item 31|Item 32|

To make the data analysis process possible, we need to reshape the dataset. Let's add new column 'Transaction_ID' and assign every row with unique value as the primary key

```sql

alter table "MBA".groceries 
add transaction_id int generated always as identity

```
then convert row to column

```sql

select g.transaction_id, p.*
from "MBA".groceries g 
	cross join lateral (
		values
			(g."Item 1", 'Item 1'),
			(g."Item 2", 'Item 2'),
			(g."Item 3", 'Item 3'),
			(g."Item 4", 'Item 4'),
			(g."Item 5", 'Item 5'),
			(g."Item 6", 'Item 6'),
			(g."Item 7", 'Item 7'),
			(g."Item 8", 'Item 8'),
			(g."Item 9", 'Item 9'),
			(g."Item 10", 'Item 10'),
			(g."Item 11", 'Item 11'),
			(g."Item 12", 'Item 12'),
			(g."Item 13", 'Item 13'),
			(g."Item 14", 'Item 14'),
			(g."Item 15", 'Item 15'),
			(g."Item 16", 'Item 16'),
			(g."Item 17", 'Item 17'),
			(g."Item 18", 'Item 18'),
			(g."Item 19", 'Item 19'),
			(g."Item 20", 'Item 20'),
			(g."Item 21", 'Item 21'),
			(g."Item 22", 'Item 22'),
			(g."Item 23", 'Item 23'),
			(g."Item 24", 'Item 24'),
			(g."Item 25", 'Item 25'),
			(g."Item 26", 'Item 26'),
			(g."Item 27", 'Item 27'),
			(g."Item 28", 'Item 28'),
			(g."Item 29", 'Item 29'),
			(g."Item 30", 'Item 30'),
			(g."Item 31", 'Item 31'),
			(g."Item 32", 'Item 32')
	) as p(product, item)
order by transaction_id
limit 10

```

|transaction_id|product            |item   |
|--------------|-------------------|-------|
|1             |semi-finished bread|Item 2 |
|1             |margarine          |Item 3 |
|1             |ready soups        |Item 4 |
|1             |                   |Item 5 |

|1             |                   |Item 9 |
|1             |                   |Item 10|
|1             |citrus fruit       |Item 1 |

### 1.2 Cleaning Data

As you can see the table above, there are still rows with blank values, we can delete all of them so it won't mess with our analysis.

```sql

with cte as
(select 
	product,
	support
from
(select 
	product,
	cast (count(*) as numeric (10,5)) / (select cast (count(*) as numeric (10,5)) from "MBA".uncleaned_groceries) as support
from "MBA".uncleaned_groceries
group by 1)
where support < 0.002
order by 2 desc)

delete from "MBA".uncleaned_groceries a
where a.product in (select product from cte)

```

|transaction_id|product            |item  |
|--------------|-------------------|------|
|1             |citrus fruit       |Item 1|
|1             |semi-finished bread|Item 2|
|1             |margarine          |Item 3|
|2             |tropical fruit     |Item 1|
|2             |yogurt             |Item 2|
|2             |coffee             |Item 3|
|3             |whole milk         |Item 1|
|4             |pip fruit          |Item 1|
|4             |yogurt             |Item 2|
|4             |cream cheese       |Item 3|

There are items that has low support value(means the product has low percentage of being bought by the consument). Since we deal with a very large dataset, we have to narrow it down. Let's delete all the items that has support value below 0.002. after eliminate all of them, here's the data overview

```sql

select
	count (distinct product) as unique_item
from "MBA".uncleaned_groceries


```

|unique_item|
|-----------|
|94         |

There are 94 different type of items in this dataset

## 2. DATA ANALYSIS
### 2.1 Most Purchased Item

it's important to know more about our dataset, here's top 10 most purchased product in the dataset

```sql

select 
	product,
	count (product) as purchased_count
from "MBA".uncleaned_groceries
group by 1
order by 2 desc
limit 10

```
|product         |purchased_count|
|----------------|---------------|
|whole milk      |2,513          |
|other vegetables|1,903          |
|rolls/buns      |1,809          |
|soda            |1,715          |
|yogurt          |1,372          |
|bottled water   |1,087          |
|root vegetables |1,072          |
|tropical fruit  |1,032          |
|shopping bags   |969            |
|sausage         |924            |


### 2.1 Support Calculation
After dataset were cleaned and ready, we can conduct our analysis process. Let's begin with calculate the support value for every combination. item_a is antecedent and item_b is consequent

```sql

select 
	a.product as item_A,
	b.product as item_B,
	cast ((count(*)) as numeric (10,5)) / (select cast (count (*) as numeric (10,5)) from "MBA".uncleaned_groceries) as support
from "MBA".uncleaned_groceries a
join "MBA".uncleaned_groceries b on a.transaction_id = b.transaction_id 
where a.product < b.product 
group by 1,2
order by 3 desc
limit 10

```

|item_a          |item_b         |support     |
|----------------|---------------|------------|
|other vegetables|whole milk     |0.0181303116|
|rolls/buns      |whole milk     |0.0137209016|
|whole milk      |yogurt         |0.0135731001|
|root vegetables |whole milk     |0.0118487498|
|other vegetables|root vegetables|0.0114792462|
|other vegetables|yogurt         |0.0105185368|
|other vegetables|rolls/buns     |0.0103214682|
|tropical fruit  |whole milk     |0.0102475674|
|soda            |whole milk     |0.0097056288|
|rolls/buns      |soda           |0.009286858 |

product 'other vegetables' and 'whole milk' is the most purchased item combination with the chances of 1.81% being in the same basket together out of all transactions

### 2.3 Confidence Calculation

```sql

select 
	a.product as item_A,
	b.product as item_B,
	counta.freq_a,
	cast ((count(*)) as numeric (10,5)) as freq_ab,
	(cast ((count(*)) as numeric (10,5)) / counta.freq_a) as confidence
from
"MBA".uncleaned_groceries a join
"MBA".uncleaned_groceries b on a.transaction_id = b.transaction_id and a.product < b.product join 
	(
	select 
		product,
		cast ((count(*)) as numeric (10,5)) as freq_a
	from "MBA".uncleaned_groceries
	group by 1
	) as counta on a.product = counta.product
group by 1,2,3
order by 4 desc
limit 10

```

|item_a          |item_b         |freq_a|freq_ab|confidence  |
|----------------|---------------|------|-------|------------|
|other vegetables|whole milk     |1,903 |736    |0.3867577509|
|rolls/buns      |whole milk     |1,809 |557    |0.3079049198|
|whole milk      |yogurt         |2,513 |551    |0.2192598488|
|root vegetables |whole milk     |1,072 |481    |0.4486940299|
|other vegetables|root vegetables|1,903 |466    |0.2448765108|
|other vegetables|yogurt         |1,903 |427    |0.2243825539|
|other vegetables|rolls/buns     |1,903 |419    |0.2201786653|
|tropical fruit  |whole milk     |1,032 |416    |0.4031007752|
|soda            |whole milk     |1,715 |394    |0.2297376093|
|rolls/buns      |soda           |1,809 |377    |0.2084024323|

From the calculation above, we can be 38% confidence that if 'other vegetables' being purchased, 'whole milk' also got purchased

### 2.4 Lift Calculation

```sql
select 
	a.product as item_a,
	b.product as item_b,
	(cast (count(*) as numeric (10,5)) / (select cast (count (*) as numeric (10,5)) from "MBA".uncleaned_groceries)) /
	(((select cast (count(*) as numeric (10,5)) from "MBA".uncleaned_groceries where product = a.product) / (select cast (count(*) as numeric (10,5)) from "MBA".uncleaned_groceries)) *
	((select cast (count(*) as numeric (10,5)) from "MBA".uncleaned_groceries where product = b.product) / (select cast (count(*) as numeric (10,5)) from "MBA".uncleaned_groceries))) as lift
from "MBA".uncleaned_groceries a
join "MBA".uncleaned_groceries b on a.transaction_id = b.transaction_id 
where a.product < b.product
group by 1,2
order by lift desc 
limit 10

```

|item_a           |item_b          |lift         |
|-----------------|----------------|-------------|
|mayonnaise       |mustard         |53.5150659134|
|liquor           |red/blush wine  |41.381243629 |
|flour            |sugar           |34.9323885289|
|ham              |processed cheese|29.1854390337|
|canned vegetables|salt            |28.9035243859|
|cling film/bags  |dish cleaner    |28.1518723994|
|canned fish      |mayonnaise      |27.4290540541|
|cat food         |pet care        |24.7797811898|
|processed cheese |white bread     |24.6642808453|
|baking powder    |flour           |24.5583787054|

Customers who buy 'mayonnaise' are 53.51 times more likely to buy 'mustard'
